# Sign to Speech Converter

A simple web-based Sign-to-Speech prototype that uses a webcam to detect hand signs 
(fake detection for demo purposes) and converts the detected sign into speech using 
the Web Speech API.

This project includes:
- Webcam live feed
- Basic (dummy) sign recognition logic
- Speech synthesis output
- Clean and simple UI
